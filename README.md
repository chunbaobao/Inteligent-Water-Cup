# Intelligent Water Dispenser System based on 51 MCU

This is an intelligent water dispenser system based on the 51 MCU, which can detect and display temperature, weight, time, and other information, and supports automatic heating or cooling, timed reminders to drink water, and other functions.

## Features

- Accurate and real-time display of temperature, weight, and time information
- Automatic heating or cooling function
- Timed reminders and buzzer reminders to drink water
- User-friendly interface

## Requirements

- 51 MCU(STC89C52)
- Temperature sensor(DS18B20)
- Weight sensor(HX711)
- Time module(DS1302)
- Heating or cooling module
## Simulation

We have created a simulation of the Intelligent Water Dispenser System using Proteus software. You can find the simulation files in the simulation directory.
It should be noted that, the simulation project need hex files:711.hex(Weighing Module) and Project.hex(51 code)

## Installation

1. Connect the temperature sensor, weight sensor, time module, and heating or cooling module to the 51 MCU board.
2. Download and install the required libraries.
3. Upload the code to the MCU board.

## Usage

1. Turn on the water dispenser system.
2. The temperature, weight, and time information will be displayed on the screen.
3. Press the heating or cooling button to adjust the temperature.
4. Set the timed reminder to drink water.
5. Enjoy your intelligent water dispenser system!
